Hey, there! I was pursuing a Web Development internship at InnoByte Services, Delhi. It was a remote internship in which I got a project to work on, redesign and make the website responsive. The King Sukh's Guest House website was to be redesigned and I had to make it look aesthetic. This was my first internship which I started on August 5th, 2024 to September 4th, 2024.

I had a great time working on this project, it helped me in understanding of the core concepts, boosted my web development skills and helped me gain some experience which I needed. I used the basics, i.e., HTML, CSS (Bootstrap, a little) and JavaScript to build this website.
